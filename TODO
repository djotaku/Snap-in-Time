Overhaul notes:

For utils/time:

Function: 

Other functions that make lists make of priordate call returns. (If needed. Better to do a naive cull for the monthly cull - just looking at groups of 7 days and picking the last one?)

Culling

New naive coding: This is for someone who has their computer always on. Since btrfs snaps are relatively cheap, just don’t care if the computer is off for a day or a week - if you have a few extra ones they’ll be eventually cleaned up by the Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly culls

Easy ones:
Go back 3 days -> cull to 4 hourly on that day (done)
Go back 7 days -> cull to 1 for that day (done)
Go back to previous quarter -> cull to one per week
Go back to previous year -> cull to one per quarter

Dev steps:
Local Culling / unit tests
If not already done, get code coverage back to 100%

15 March: may want to test print_output and/or other parts of culling to make sure things still work correctly if there's only one subvol
