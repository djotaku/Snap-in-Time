Culling

New naive coding: This is for someone who has their computer always on. Since btrfs snaps are relatively cheap, just don’t care if the computer is off for a day or a week - if you have a few extra ones they’ll be eventually cleaned up by the Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly culls

Easy ones:
Go back 3 days -> cull to 4 hourly on that day (done)
Go back 7 days -> cull to 1 for that day (done)
Go back to previous quarter -> cull to one per week (done)
Go back to previous year -> cull to one per quarter
