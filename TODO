Overhaul notes: 

Use what have learned recently:

-functional programming for easy unit testing - each should only be doing one thing (and should probably take arguments
-make a package
-pytest unit tests from the beginning
-mypy/static testing from beginning
-flake8
-Github CI
-setup.py and setup.cfg for Python package
-use config files rather than hard-coding
JSON file where each subvol has attributes: 
Subvol
Backup location
Remote location
-instead of one massive, headache-inducing file - split it up into lots of submodules
create_local_snapshots - create local snapshots
Local_culling - thin the local snapshots
Push_remote - needs to grab remote snapshots and determine newest one, needs to determine newest snapshot on remote, try a send to remote, verify that send worked
Maybe current snapintime.py (rename to snap_in_time.py) pulls it all together. If use arguments, use argparse

For subprocess - look at the documentation because I was using it naively, and it may be possible that it can let me know if things didn’t work and why - for presenting to user, making decisions on whether to continue, mailing out error status?

For utils/time:

Function: 

Other functions that make lists make of priordate call returns. (If needed. Better to do a naive cull for the monthly cull - just looking at groups of 7 days and picking the last one?)

Culling

New naive coding: This is for someone who has their computer always on. Since btrfs snaps are relatively cheap, just don’t care if the computer is off for a day or a week - if you have a few extra ones they’ll be eventually cleaned up by the Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly culls

Easy ones:
Go back 3 days -> cull to 4 hourly on that day
Go back 7 days -> cull to 1 for that day
Go back to previous month -> cull to one per 7 days (29-31 will not be culled, but will be caught on the quarterly one; also allows me to cheat since every month has AT LEAST 28 days)
Go back to previous quarter -> cull to one per month
Go back to previous year -> cull to one per quarter
